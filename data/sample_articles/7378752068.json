    "body": "The global economy is at a critical crossroads with a number of interlocking challenges and crises running in parallel. The uncertainty around how Russia's war on Ukraine will play out this year and the war's role in creating global instability means that the trouble on the inflation front is not over yet.\n\nNew York, Feb. 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Global Cargo Shipping Industry\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05798102/?utm_source=GNW\n\nFood and fuel inflation will remain a persistent economic problem. Higher retail inflation will impact consumer confidence and spending. As governments combat inflation by raising interest rates, new job creation will slowdown and impact economic activity and growth. Lower capital expenditure is in the offing as companies go slow on investments, held back by inflation worries and weaker demand. With slower growth and high inflation, developed markets seem primed to enter into a recession. Fears of new COVID outbreaks and China's already uncertain post-pandemic path poses a real risk of the world experiencing more acute supply chain pain and manufacturing disruptions this year. Volatile financial markets, growing trade tensions, stricter regulatory environment and pressure to mainstream climate change into economic decisions will compound the complexity of challenges faced. Year 2023 is expected to be tough year for most markets, investors and consumers. Nevertheless, there is always opportunity for businesses and their leaders who can chart a path forward with resilience and adaptability.\n\nGlobal Cargo Shipping Market to Reach 12.5 Billion Metric Tons by 2030\n\nIn the changed post COVID-19 business landscape, the global market for Cargo Shipping estimated at 10.8 Billion Metric Tons in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of 12.5 Billion Metric Tons by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 1.9% over the analysis period 2022-2030. General Cargo, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to record a 2.1% CAGR and reach 6.5 Billion Metric Tons by the end of the analysis period. Taking into account the ongoing post pandemic recovery, growth in the Container Cargo segment is readjusted to a revised 2.4% CAGR for the next 8-year period.\n\nThe U.S. Market is Estimated at 3.1 Billion Metric Tons, While China is Forecast to Grow at 1.6% CAGR\n\nThe Cargo Shipping market in the U.S. is estimated at 3.1 Billion Metric Tons in the year 2022.
